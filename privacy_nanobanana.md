# Privacy Policy — NanoBanana AI Photo Processing

Last updated: 2025-09-02

This Privacy Policy explains how we handle photos and related data when you use our AI photo processing application ("Service"). By using the Service, you agree to the practices described below.

### 1) What we process
- Uploaded photos: You provide a photo to generate results. We process it solely to deliver the Service to you.
- Generated images: Images produced by the Service for you. We process them only to deliver the results to you.

We do not use your photos or generated images for any other purposes (such as training, analytics, marketing, or advertising), and we do not sell your content.

### 2) Storage and deletion
- Uploaded photos are stored on our servers for up to 3 days, after which they are automatically and irreversibly deleted.
- Generated images are retained only as needed to deliver them to you and follow the same 3‑day deletion schedule.

If you need earlier deletion, contact us at: scofield665@gmail.com.

### 3) Access via direct link (your responsibility)
- Your uploaded photo can be accessed via a direct link. We do not store this link on our servers. Only you have the link.
- Anyone who obtains the link can view the content. For your privacy, do not share the link with others and keep it secure.
- Because we do not store the link, we cannot recover, revoke, or reissue it for you. If a link is exposed, re‑upload the photo (or wait for automatic deletion within 3 days).

We do not additionally store links to your photos or generated images. Links exist only on your side, and you are solely responsible for keeping them private.

### 4) Legal basis and acceptable use
You must have all necessary rights and permissions to upload photos and to process them through the Service, including any required consent from people depicted. Do not upload illegal or harmful content.

### 5) Security
We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your content while it is stored. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

### 6) Third‑party infrastructure
We may use reputable cloud or hosting providers to operate the Service. They act on our behalf to store and process data strictly to provide the Service and are not permitted to use your content for their own purposes.

### 7) Your choices and rights
- You can request early deletion of your data by emailing us at scofield665@gmail.com.
- If you lose a direct link, we cannot restore it because we do not store links. You will need to re‑upload your photo or wait for automatic deletion.

### 8) Children’s privacy
The Service is not intended for children. Do not use the Service if you are under the age at which you can provide consent to data processing in your country.

### 9) Changes to this Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version here. Your continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the updated Policy.

### 10) Disclaimers and limitation of liability
The Service and any generated images are provided "as is" and "as available." To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties and are not liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for losses arising from: (a) your sharing or mishandling of direct links; (b) access by anyone who obtains a link from you; (c) any caching, copying, or redistribution by third parties; or (d) events beyond our reasonable control. Where liability cannot be disclaimed, it is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

### 11) Contact
For questions or requests (including early deletion), contact: scofield665@gmail.com.

### 12) Face data
- What we consider face data: pixel data of faces within uploaded photos and any temporary, derived data strictly required to apply effects (for example, face bounding boxes, landmark points, or segmentation masks computed in memory during processing).
- What we do not collect: we do not create or store biometric identifiers, face templates, face embeddings, or any data used for identity recognition or authentication. We do not perform face recognition or identity matching.

Collection: Face data is collected only if a photo you upload contains a face. We do not request separate face scans and do not collect any additional face data beyond what is present in the uploaded image and the ephemeral, in-memory derivatives needed to process it.

Use: Face data is used solely to provide the requested AI photo processing (for example, applying effects to the face region). It is not used for analytics, advertising, model training, or any other secondary purpose.

Sharing and storage: We do not share face data with third parties except trusted service providers (such as cloud or hosting vendors) who act on our behalf to operate the Service and are not permitted to use your content for their own purposes. Face data is stored only as part of your uploaded photo and generated images in our server environment. Your content may be accessible via a direct link that only you possess; we do not store or index this link. Do not share the link.

Retention: Face data persists only as long as the associated photo and generated images are retained. Uploaded photos and generated images are automatically deleted within 3 days. Any derived processing data (such as landmarks or masks) is not persisted and is discarded once processing is complete.

Storage location: Data is stored on servers operated by reputable cloud providers on our behalf. The specific storage region may vary. We implement reasonable measures to protect your content while it is stored.

No sale or secondary use: We do not sell your face data, photos, or generated images, and we do not use them to train models.
